A directory is a collection of files and subdirectories. A directory inside a directory is known as a subdirectory.
Python has the os module that provides us with many useful methods to work with directories (and files as well).


We can get the present working directory using the getcwd() method of the os module.

In Python, we can change the current working directory by using the chdir() method.
The new path that we want to change into must be supplied as a string to this method. And we can use both the forward-slash / or the backward-slash \ to separate the path elements.

All files and sub-directories inside a directory can be retrieved using the listdir() method.

In Python, we can make a new directory using the mkdir() method.

The rename() method can rename a directory or a file.
For renaming any directory or file, rename() takes in two basic arguments:
the old name as the first argument
the new name as the second argument.

In Python, we can use the remove() method or the rmdir() method to remove a file or directory.
In order to remove a non-empty directory, we can use the rmtree() method inside the shutil module.
