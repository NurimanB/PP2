FILE HANDLING
The key function for working with files in Python is the open() function.
The open() function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.

There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file:
"r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist
"a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist
"w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist
"x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists
In addition you can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode:
"t" - Text - Default value. Text mode
"b" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images)

READ FILES
The open() function returns a file object, which has a read() method for reading the content of the file:

Return the 5 first characters of the file:
f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.read(5))

You can return one line by using the readline() method:
By calling readline() two times, you can read the two first lines:

WRITE/CREARE FILES
To write to an existing file, you must add a parameter to the open() function:
"x" - Create - will create a file, returns an error if the file exist

"a" - Append - will append to the end of the file

"w" - Write - will overwrite any existing content

DELETE FILES
To delete a file, you must import the OS module, and run its os.remove() function:

To avoid getting an error, you might want to check if the file exists before you try to delete it:
import os
if os.path.exists("demofile.txt"):
  os.remove("demofile.txt")
else:
  print("The file does not exist")
